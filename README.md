### CKLengds-Leveling
This project was developped at first by Hylted_ (Hylted_#6778 on Discord).
It was maded for having a leveling system on the guild "CK Legends"

### Run
Please install (Python)[https://python.org], `discord.py` library and `sqlite3` library.
You can install a library by doing the following command,
If you are on Windows, use `pip install <library name>`, for example `pip install discord.py`
If you aren't on Windows, use `python3 -m pip install <library name>`, for example `python3 -m pip install discord.py`
This bot was ONLY tested on Linux systems.

After you installed them all, please go in the directory where is the program with cd command and use, if you are on Windows, `python main.py`, or if you aren't, use `python3 main.py`
Please make sure you are in the right directory, you still can run that program for another directory, but the database will be saved on the directory you are in.
